FireGSS is a desktop client for the [GSS](http://code.google.com/p/gss/) scalable storage service. It is implemented as either a Firefox extension or a native application for Windows, Mac and Linux, thus having access to the local system, something impossible to achieve with a web client like the one supplied with GSS.
